# import in python

'''
    Importing in python is the process of loding code from a python module into the current script.
    This allow you to use the functions and variables defined in the module in your current script, as well as any additional modules that the imported module may depend on.

#import math

#from math import sqrt,pi

#from math import *

'''
result = sqrt(9) * pi
print(result)

#  as keyword

'''
import math as m
result = m.sqrt(9)
print(result)

# THe dir functuon

'''
    Python has a built-in function called dir that you can use to view the names of all the functions and variables defined in a module.
    This can be helpful for exploring and understanding the content of a new module.
